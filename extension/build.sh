# The server URL is a build-time constant, in TWO places that must agree: SERVER_URL in config.js
# and the matching entry in manifest.json's host_permissions. The extension reads the site's
# session cookie, and Chrome only allows that for an origin the manifest declares — so a build with
# one updated and not the other fails at "Connect" with no useful message. This script writes both
# from a single argument, which is the whole reason it exists.
