// The challenge server this build talks to. Deliberately a build-time constant with no UI to

// `host_permissions` in manifest.json, and that cannot be edited at runtime either.
//
// The release builder derives this constant, the manifest's `host_permissions`, and its
// `homepage_url` from one deployed origin.
