# LinkedIn Challenge — server

A full-stack Rust app built on [nextrs](https://github.com/drewhirschi/nextrs) — an Axum backend
serving Next.js-style file routes with React client pages — with
[Toasty](https://github.com/tokio-rs/toasty) as the ORM, backed by **libsql** (Toasty's `turso`
driver) so the eventual move to hosted Turso is a connection-string change.

Ported from Topcoat; see [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md) for what moved where and the gotchas.

## Run

```sh
cargo install cargo-nextrs-dev      # one-time, the `cargo dev` watcher
cd client && npm install && cd ..   # one-time, the bundler resolves imports from here
SEED_DEMO=1 cargo dev               # http://127.0.0.1:3000, with a populated "Demo Corp" leaderboard
```

Or without the watcher: `SEED_DEMO=1 cargo run`.

Everything requires a session, so start at `/login`. The demo seed creates accounts you can use
(password `demopassword` for all of them):

- `admin@demo.test` — admin: sees the dashboard as well as the leaderboard
- `ada@demo.test`, `ben@demo.test`, `carmen@demo.test`, `dev@demo.test`, `erin@demo.test` —
  participants

Reachable signed out: `/login`, `/join` (redeem an invite code), `/signup` (create an org).

### Environment

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `turso:linkedin.db` | libsql connection. Local file now; a hosted Turso URL later. |
| `SEED_DEMO` | _(unset)_ | If set, seeds a demo org + competition + participants on first run. |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Bind port; falls back to the next free port up to +20. |

**Changing a model wipes the dev database.** `push_schema()` cannot alter an existing table, so a
new field means deleting `linkedin.db` and re-running — every account and every synced post goes
with it, and any linked extension starts getting 401s because its member row is gone. The extension
recovers on its own if the browser still has a website session; otherwise it asks the user to press
Connect.

Back up with `./backup-db.sh` first, **not** by copying `linkedin.db`. libsql keeps recent writes in
`linkedin.db-wal`, so copying the database file alone can produce a file with no tables in it —
that has already happened once here, and the real data was deleted along with the WAL. The script
folds the WAL in and refuses to leave behind a backup with zero tables.

The schema is created on first run only: Toasty's `push_schema()` issues plain `CREATE TABLE` with
no create-if-missing, so `connect()` probes for an existing table and pushes only when the database
is empty. It still does not *migrate* — after changing a model, delete `linkedin.db*` (or point
`DATABASE_URL` at a fresh file) to recreate.

### Editor setup

`tsconfig.json` at this directory's root exists so an editor opening `app/**/page.tsx` finds a
project — editors resolve against the *nearest* tsconfig above the file, and `client/tsconfig.json`
only reaches down into `../app`. Without the root one, `@server/client` reads as an unresolvable
module and every callback parameter is an implicit `any`, while `npm run typecheck` still passes.
`client/tsconfig.json` extends it, so both see the same options.

If the editor reports every generated hook as missing, run the generation order below —
`client/src/generated/index.ts` is written by `cargo build` and deleted by `npm run gen`, so
between the two the alias resolves to a barrel exporting nothing.

### Changing an API route

`route.rs` handlers annotated with `#[nextrs::api]` are the source of the OpenAPI document, which
generates both clients. Keep those attributes minimal: the macro infers the HTTP method from the
function name, the path from the file, params from the extractors, the request body from
`Json<T>`, and the 200 response from the return type. Only genuine overrides belong in the
attribute — a custom `operation_id` (which sets the hook name), and error responses.

Two things defeat that inference, both silently: returning a type *alias* such as
`ApiResult<Json<T>>` instead of `Result<Json<T>, ApiError>`, and returning a tuple like
`(HeaderMap, Json<T>)`. Either yields an operation with no response schema, so spell the type out
or declare the response by hand.

Generation: the React Query hooks the pages use, and the plain-JS client the Chrome
extension imports. After changing a handler's path, params, body, or response:

```sh
cargo install cargo-nextrs          # one-time
cargo nextrs client generate        # refreshes the contract, both clients, and publishes to the extension
cargo build                          # rewrites client/src/generated/index.ts that generation cleaned
```

`client/nextrs.client.json` points the external client at
`extension/generated/nextrs-client/`. Run generation BEFORE `cargo build`: generation cleans
`client/src/generated/`, and the Rust build is what writes the `index.ts` barrel back, so the
other order leaves `@server/client` exporting nothing.

Nothing under `client/src/generated/`, `client/openapi.json`, `public/dist/`, or
`extension/generated/` is hand-written — all of it is regenerated.

### Moving to Turso later

Toasty's `turso` driver *is* the libsql driver. Today the URL is a local file (`turso:linkedin.db`).
For hosted Turso, build the driver with a remote URL + auth token and use `Db::builder().build(driver)`
instead of `.connect(url)` — see `db-libsql-turso` notes. Nothing else changes.

## Layout

```
src/                  domain layer — a lib crate, because src/bin/dump-openapi.rs is a second
                      crate root that shares the generated route registry
  lib.rs              module list
  models.rs           Toasty models (Org, Member, Invite, Competition, Post, PostSnapshot,
                      ProfileSnapshot, AdminSession) + connect()
  scoring.rs          ScoringConfig + compute_standings (derived, weekly buckets, top-N/week,
                      follower normalization, profile points) + active_competition
  dto.rs              wire shapes + the reads behind them (leaderboard, member detail, aggregate)
  web.rs              ApiError — one JSON error shape for every route
  auth.rs             Argon2 passwords, session cookie, email lookup, bearer token (extension)
  util.rs             unix time, ISO/date parsing, invite codes, bearer tokens, a small SHA-256
  seed.rs             optional demo data
  main.rs             Db setup, CORS layer, router assembly, graceful shutdown

app/                  the router — every directory is a URL segment
  middleware.rs       root guard: signed out sees only the sign-in surfaces
  layout.tsx          root chrome, stays mounted across soft navigation
  page.tsx            / landing            (+ prefetch.rs)
  login/ join/ signup/  sign in, redeem an invite, create an org
  orgs/[slug]/        leaderboard + scoring explanation          (+ prefetch.rs)
    members/[id]/     a participant's posts by week              (+ prefetch.rs)
  admin/              dashboard; middleware.rs narrows it to is_admin
  api/                link, sync, auth/*, orgs/*, admin/*

client/               generated typed client (npm package, imported as @server/client)
public/style.css      the stylesheet
```

## How auth works

**Everyone signs in; nothing is public.** Participants and admins are both `Member` rows with an
email and an Argon2 password hash, looked up by email at login. `is_admin` is a role on top, and
the only thing it unlocks is `/admin`.

- **Sessions.** The server mints a random token, stores only its SHA-256 on an `AdminSession` row,
  and returns it as an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` cookie. `app/middleware.rs` guards every route
  except the sign-in surfaces, the auth API, the extension protocol, and static assets — a
  presence check on the cookie, since each handler verifies the session properly anyway.
  `app/admin/middleware.rs` additionally requires `is_admin` (one database lookup).
- **Getting in.** `/signup` creates an org and its first admin; `/join` redeems an invite code into
  a participant account.
- **The extension** posts the same email and password to `/api/auth/device` and gets a sync token
  back, storing only the token. Issuing rotates it, so one browser is linked at a time. `/api/link`
  then binds a LinkedIn identity to that account and `/api/sync` ingests snapshots, both
  bearer-authenticated. A permissive `CorsLayer` lets a `chrome-extension://` origin call them —
  safe precisely because they use bearer auth rather than the session cookie.
