//! Scoring is fully derived from snapshots at read time — nothing is precomputed or stored.
//!
//! Per member, per competition window, three buckets (the "three ways to score"):
//!  * **Show up**: `per_post` points for each in-window post, at most `max_posts_per_week` a week.
//!  * **Keep showing up**: `per_active_week` for every week with at least one post, plus one streak
//!    bonus — `streak_long_bonus` once the best run of consecutive active weeks reaches
//!    `streak_long_weeks`, otherwise `streak_short_bonus` at `streak_short_weeks`.
//!  * **Engagement**: each post's reactions/comments/reposts/... are priced by the `per_*` rates.
//!    A post counts fully up to `engagement_cap` and then keeps earning at
//!    `engagement_over_cap_rate`, so a post that goes big still counts for more. Only the best
//!    `max_posts_per_week` posts a week count, and the sum is optionally scaled by
//!    `follower_baseline / follower_count` so audience size doesn't decide the board.
//!
//! Profile points (followers gained, profile views) remain available for challenges that price
//! them; the LinkedIn Cup rules leave those rates at zero.
