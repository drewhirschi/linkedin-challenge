//! Automatic enrollment: everyone is a participant in whatever challenge is currently running.
//!
//! Invitations still exist for owners and for challenges that haven't started, but the common
//! case — a teammate signs up while the Cup is on — should put them on the board with no one
//! having to do anything. Enrollment happens on signup, on login (so accounts created before the
//! challenge pick it up the next time they sign in), and once at server start for everyone.
